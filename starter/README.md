# Simple Tailwind CSS Starter

This is an extremely simple setup to develop Tailwind projects. This will be used in my Tailwind From Scratch course.

## Usage

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run Tailwind CLI in watch mode

```
npm run dev
```

- You can use Tailwind classes in any `.html` files in the root directory.
- Put any custom CSS that you may have in the `src/input.css` file.
- Add any config values to the `tailwind.config.js` file.

### To build once

```
npm run build
```

- You only need to deploy your HTML files and `css/style.css`.
